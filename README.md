# StockService

Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:
- The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was 10:00am local time.
- The values are the price in dollars of the stock at that time.
- So if the stock cost $5 at 11:00am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 5.

Write an efficient function that takes an array of stock prices and returns the best profit could have been made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 stock.

For example:
```
int[] stockPrices = {10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9};
Assert.assertEquals (6, getMaxProfit(stockPrices)); // returns 6 (buy at $5 sell at $11)
```
You must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).
